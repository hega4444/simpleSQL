(Anita Pouchard Serra/The New York Times)\\\\n\\\\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina \\\\u2014 Javier Milei , a far-right libertarian economist, has stayed aloft in Argentina\\\\u2019s presidential campaign on the wings of the youth vote.\\\\n\\\\nTo win the runoff election this month, he will need to hold on to that key demographic, pollsters say. But now, a major hurdle stands in his way: Swifties.\\\\n\\\\nSquadrons of Argentine fans of pop star Taylor Swift have gotten political. They have trained their online sights on Milei and his rising libertarian party, framing them as a danger to Argentina, while Swift herself is preparing to arrive in Argentina next week for the launch of her Eras Tour outside North America.\\\\n\\\\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cMilei=Trump,\\\\u201d said one post from a group called Swifties Against Freedom Advances, which is the name of Milei\\\\u2019s party.\\\\n\\\\nAfter Milei placed second in Argentina\\\\u2019s election last month, sending him to a runoff on Nov. 19, a group of 10 Argentine fans of Swift created the group and issued a news release calling on fellow fans to vote against Milei. They said they were inspired by Swift\\\\u2019s past efforts to confront right-wing politicians in the United States.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWe cannot not fight after having heard and seen Taylor give everything so that the right doesn\\\\u2019t win in her country,\\\\u201d the group said in the statement. \\\\u201cAs Taylor says, we have to be on the right side of history.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe two-page missive was viewed 1.5 million times on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, before it suspended the group\\\\u2019s account without explanation, the group said.\\\\n\\\\nIn the statement, it called Milei\\\\u2019s positions against legal abortion, his support for the loosening of gun laws and his proposals to overhaul public education and public health care as \\\\u201ca danger to democracy.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe statement also took aim at Milei\\\\u2019s comments that criticized feminism, claimed a pay gap between men and women does not exist and referred to the atrocities committed by Argentina\\\\u2019s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 as simply \\\\u201cexcesses.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMilei, in response, has shrugged off the Swifties. \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not the far right,\\\\u201d he told a radio station. \\\\u201cThey can express what they want.\\\\u201d His campaign declined to comment.\\\\n\\\\nSwift, who will perform the first of a series of three sold-out shows in Buenos Aires on Thursday, has not commented publicly on the Argentine election.\\\\n\\\\nThe Swifties\\\\u2019 criticism of Milei has shifted the conversation to his conservative social views and away from his drastic proposals to reverse Argentina\\\\u2019s economic crisis, which include ditching the Argentine peso for the U.S. dollar and closing the country\\\\u2019s central bank.\\\\n\\\\nBut it isn\\\\u2019t just Swifties who are organizing against Milei. He and his running mate, Victoria Villarruel, are also contending with criticism from legions of loyal fans of another musical juggernaut, the K-pop band BTS. They are so active and organized on the internet that they have become known as the BTS Army.\\\\n\\\\nLast week, the fury of that army was unleashed upon Villarruel after a series of her tweets denigrating the K-pop group resurfaced. In 2020, she likened the name BTS to a sexually transmitted disease. She also mocked the dyed pink and green hair of some members.\\\\n\\\\nThose tweets prompted such a fierce response from BTS fans, accusing her of xenophobia, that a large BTS fan club in Argentina felt compelled to try to calm their fellow fans down. \\\\u201cThe message that BTS always transmits is one of respect to oneself and everyone else,\\\\u201d said a statement from the club, which has been viewed 1.9 million times, according to X.\\\\n\\\\nVillarruel\\\\u2019s only reaction online to the BTS blowback has been a post in which she called her STD post part of \\\\u201cfunny chats\\\\u201d from \\\\u201ca thousand years ago.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMilei\\\\u2019s political base is particularly reliant on young voters. One survey of 2,400 people in October showed that nearly 27% of his support came from people ages 17 to 25, versus less than 9% for Sergio Massa, the center-left economy minister who opposes Milei in the runoff. People under 29 account for 27% of all eligible voters in Argentina.\\\\n\\\\nMany young voters said they see Milei, who has taken to wearing leather jackets and wielding a chain saw at his campaign events, as the \\\\u201ccool\\\\u201d outsider candidate who has also become a sort of online meme.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe majority of people our age, from about 16 to 25, are voting for him,\\\\u201d said Mateo Guevara, 21, a student who attended a Milei rally last month in Salta, a northern city. \\\\u201cHe is a guy that came out of nowhere.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMilei and Massa appear to be headed toward a close contest. A poll published Friday by Atlas Intel showed that Milei had a lead of 4 percentage points, with a margin of error of 2 points.\\\\n\\\\nSwift shunned politics for most of her career.

(Anita Pouchard Serra/The New York Times)\\\\n\\\\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina \\\\u2014 Javier Milei , a far-right libertarian economist, has stayed aloft in Argentina\\\\u2019s presidential campaign on the wings of the youth vote.\\\\n\\\\nTo win the runoff election this month, he will need to hold on to that key demographic, pollsters say. But now, a major hurdle stands in his way: Swifties.\\\\n\\\\nSquadrons of Argentine fans of pop star Taylor Swift have gotten political. They have trained their online sights on Milei and his rising libertarian party, framing them as a danger to Argentina, while Swift herself is preparing to arrive in Argentina next week for the launch of her Eras Tour outside North America.\\\\n\\\\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cMilei=Trump,\\\\u201d said one post from a group called Swifties Against Freedom Advances, which is the name of Milei\\\\u2019s party.\\\\n\\\\nAfter Milei placed second in Argentina\\\\u2019s election last month, sending him to a runoff on Nov. 19, a group of 10 Argentine fans of Swift created the group and issued a news release calling on fellow fans to vote against Milei. They said they were inspired by Swift\\\\u2019s past efforts to confront right-wing politicians in the United States.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWe cannot not fight after having heard and seen Taylor give everything so that the right doesn\\\\u2019t win in her country,\\\\u201d the group said in the statement. \\\\u201cAs Taylor says, we have to be on the right side of history.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe two-page missive was viewed 1.5 million times on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, before it suspended the group\\\\u2019s account without explanation, the group said.\\\\n\\\\nIn the statement, it called Milei\\\\u2019s positions against legal abortion, his support for the loosening of gun laws and his proposals to overhaul public education and public health care as \\\\u201ca danger to democracy.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe statement also took aim at Milei\\\\u2019s comments that criticized feminism, claimed a pay gap between men and women does not exist and referred to the atrocities committed by Argentina\\\\u2019s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 as simply \\\\u201cexcesses.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMilei, in response, has shrugged off the Swifties. \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not the far right,\\\\u201d he told a radio station. \\\\u201cThey can express what they want.\\\\u201d His campaign declined to comment.\\\\n\\\\nSwift, who will perform the first of a series of three sold-out shows in Buenos Aires on Thursday, has not commented publicly on the Argentine election.\\\\n\\\\nThe Swifties\\\\u2019 criticism of Milei has shifted the conversation to his conservative social views and away from his drastic proposals to reverse Argentina\\\\u2019s economic crisis, which include ditching the Argentine peso for the U.S. dollar and closing the country\\\\u2019s central bank.\\\\n\\\\nBut it isn\\\\u2019t just Swifties who are organizing against Milei. He and his running mate, Victoria Villarruel, are also contending with criticism from legions of loyal fans of another musical juggernaut, the K-pop band BTS. They are so active and organized on the internet that they have become known as the BTS Army.\\\\n\\\\nLast week, the fury of that army was unleashed upon Villarruel after a series of her tweets denigrating the K-pop group resurfaced. In 2020, she likened the name BTS to a sexually transmitted disease. She also mocked the dyed pink and green hair of some members.\\\\n\\\\nThose tweets prompted such a fierce response from BTS fans, accusing her of xenophobia, that a large BTS fan club in Argentina felt compelled to try to calm their fellow fans down. \\\\u201cThe message that BTS always transmits is one of respect to oneself and everyone else,\\\\u201d said a statement from the club, which has been viewed 1.9 million times, according to X.\\\\n\\\\nVillarruel\\\\u2019s only reaction online to the BTS blowback has been a post in which she called her STD post part of \\\\u201cfunny chats\\\\u201d from \\\\u201ca thousand years ago.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMilei\\\\u2019s political base is particularly reliant on young voters. One survey of 2,400 people in October showed that nearly 27% of his support came from people ages 17 to 25, versus less than 9% for Sergio Massa, the center-left economy minister who opposes Milei in the runoff. People under 29 account for 27% of all eligible voters in Argentina.\\\\n\\\\nMany young voters said they see Milei, who has taken to wearing leather jackets and wielding a chain saw at his campaign events, as the \\\\u201ccool\\\\u201d outsider candidate who has also become a sort of online meme.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe majority of people our age, from about 16 to 25, are voting for him,\\\\u201d said Mateo Guevara, 21, a student who attended a Milei rally last month in Salta, a northern city. \\\\u201cHe is a guy that came out of nowhere.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMilei and Massa appear to be headed toward a close contest. A poll published Friday by Atlas Intel showed that Milei had a lead of 4 percentage points, with a margin of error of 2 points.\\\\n\\\\nSwift shunned politics for most of her career. But in 2018 she broke her silence to oppose Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn in Swift\\\\u2019s home state, Tennessee, helping to trigger a spike in young-voter registrations in the U.S. midterms that year.\\\\n\\\\nSwift said she felt compelled to speak out against Blackburn, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, because the politician\\\\u2019s record \\\\u201cappalls and terrifies me,\\\\u201d including positions on equal pay for women, violence against women and gay rights. Blackburn wound up winning.\\\\n\\\\nSwift\\\\u2019s song \\\\u201cOnly the Young,\\\\u201d a rallying cry that describes young people as agents of change, was featured in an ad from Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., in a push to get out the vote in 2020.\\\\n\\\\nAnd Swift\\\\u2019s comments in a 2020 documentary, in which she said she had decided to publicly oppose Trump despite the risk to her career, have been circulating widely in Argentina in recent weeks.\\\\n\\\\nBTS fans are their own political force, having most likely helped suppress turnout at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2020 by reserving seats and not showing up.\\\\n\\\\nOutside the River Plate soccer stadium in Buenos Aires, where Swift will perform next week, a contingent of Swifties has been camping out to see the show. Many said they were not eager to mix politics with music.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe reality of the United States is a very different reality than the one that we are living here,\\\\u201d said Barbara Alcibiade, 22, a pastry chef. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s true that a large percentage of fans may or may not follow certain ideals or the values that she represents, but that doesn\\\\u2019t mean that represents everyone.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe Swifties behind the anti-Milei news release said they never claimed to speak for Swift or all her fans. \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s why we were very careful not to say that Taylor wouldn\\\\u2019t vote for Javier Milei,\\\\u201d said one member, Macarena, 29, who declined to give her last name because she said the group had received threats online.\\\\n\\\\nBut for Macarena and her friends, the parallels between Milei and Trump are clear. \\\\u201cThere isn\\\\u2019t any Taylor statement that you can use to say that I\\\\u2019m going to vote for a candidate from the far right,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\nAt a K-pop dance school in Buenos Aires, BTS fans said the 2020 comments by Milei\\\\u2019s running mate disparaging the group served only to reinforce their aversion to Milei.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt was really upsetting because it\\\\u2019s always the same thing, xenophobic attacks, treating them as if they\\\\u2019re different,\\\\u201d said Marcela Toyos, 36, a teacher, after dancing to the BTS hit \\\\u201cMic Drop.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMacarena said she and her friends have a WhatsApp group of 140 Swifties in Buenos Aires that is planning to put up posters opposing Milei outside Swift\\\\u2019s concerts next week.
